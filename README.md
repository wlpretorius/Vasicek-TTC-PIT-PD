# Vasicek-TTC-PIT-PD

This project provides a framework to convert TTC PDs to PIT PDs using the Vasicek one-factor model. The first stage is to complete the singular coefficent model, that is, where only one macro economic variable is considered. A dashboard will be built using Streamlit such that the user can import the PD matrix and respective macro economic variable. Stage 2 will be the development of a multi-factor model. An additional Streamlit dashboard would be built for this scenario. For now, we assume a linear regression model to forecast the respective TTC PDs and macro economic variables. This can be adjusted in the future.
